The vacuum cleaner robot uses sensors to detect the presence of 
objects around the robot and uses this data to not collide the robot 
over those objects. To detect an Object, we used an IR sensor and an 
Ultrasonic sensor. According to the above figure mentioned, we 
connected the two IR sensors on both sides (Right side and left side) 
respectively, and one Ultrasonic sensor connected to the front side.
The dust bin full detection system in your vacuum cleaner robot uses 
a limit switch to check if the dust bin is full. The limit switch is a type 
of electrical switch that is activated when a physical object comes into 
contact with it. In this case, the limit switch is activated by pulling the 
plastic plate causing dust and waste. If the limit switch is activated, it 
will send a message as “Dustbin - FULL” in the LCD display (16*2 
display), blinking the LED, and turning on the buzzer.
